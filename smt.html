    <h1>Okay, buckle down—this is going to take a while</h1>
    <p>I have had an intense interest in the video game series Shin Megami Tensei since my freshman year of high school. 
      It began with playing the spin-off series Persona (specifically Persona 3 Portable for the PSP) and then branching off into 
      the main series and the other Persona spin-off games.</p>

    <h2>What is Shin Megami Tensei?</h2>
    <p>Shin Megami Tensei is a Japanese media franchise primarily consisting of video games but also 
      consisting of books, movies, TV shows, and weird somewhat uncomfortable stage plays where adults attempt to imitate fictional high schoolers 
      with superpowers.</p>
    <p>The series is developed by the company Atlus and owned by Sega (you know, the guys who made that funky blue hedgehog that runs fast) 
      and actually began as a series of science fiction novels known as “Digital Devil Story” written by Aya Nishitani, released on March 31st, 1986. 
      The first actual game in the franchise as we know it today was released a year later in 1987 under the name “Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei” for the Famicom. 
      Depicted below is the mascot of the series, Jack Frost, the snowman whose catchphrase is "Hee Ho!"</p>

    <h2>Persona 3</h2>
    <p>Great story, great themes about the inevitability of death, the use of blues to convey the sadness that dominates the entire 
      story from beginning to end is great. I’d actually say the blue used throughout the game portrays a message of sadness at 
      the beginning but towards the end it is also meant to symbolize the peace that comes in death. This is further underscored by 
      the final scene of the game where Aigis (one of your party members) comforts the main character as he passes away from sacrificing 
      himself to save the world. The scene is quiet, the music is calm, it isn’t some grand departure from the world, it’s a silent 
      goodbye between friends.</p>
    <p>Did I cry?</p>
    <p>Of course I cried, what about it?</p>
    <p>Apart from the story, the actual gameplay is…fine. It’s just alright. I’m not a fan of the fatigue 
      system that kind of drags the early game. Granted, this system basically disappears in the later levels, but 
      I’m the kind of person who likes to burn through one floor of Tartarus in a night so I can focus on social 
      links the next few in-game days. So as you can imagine, having the game literally tell me to stop after four or 
      five battles is pretty annoying. JUST LET ME PLAY HOW I WANT—I DON’T CARE IF AKIHIKO IS TIRED; WE NEED TO FINISH THIS FLOOR.</p>
    <p>I have a lot to say about the remake as well, but I’m trying to keep this brief. So let's just say the remake was a massive 
      improvement visually, but in terms of some gameplay changes, they missed the mark. And in terms of cutscenes, I think the original 
      runs circles around the remake, no contest.</p>
    <p>But yeah, this game is great.</p>

  <section class="persona4">
    <h2>Persona 4</h2>
    <p>This is the best game in the series; I don’t care what anyone else says. Persona 4 stays winning.</p>
    <p>This game has fun gameplay, great characters, and the music has sent me into another plane of existence at three in the morning 
      multiple times. The setting of a small quiet Japanese town mixed with the intensity of a murder mystery investigation is 
      just such a fun and engaging time (for me, not the characters that got murdered).</p>
    <p>Honestly, there is nothing about this game I particularly disliked, apart from the dungeon design, which at some points 
      felt a bit lazy. But even so, it wasn’t so egregious that I disliked playing through them.</p>
    <p>I think the enhanced rerelease, Persona 4 Golden, added such great additional content. Playing the game in the winter 
      season when the song “Snowflakes” is playing makes me swell with emotion and nostalgia for being with friends in high school, 
      before the stresses of life and college and work made us drift apart slowly, both mentally and physically, as people moved away.</p>
    <p>I guess that’s why this game has stuck with me so long—it feels like coming home.</p>

  <section class="persona5">
    <h2>Persona 5</h2>
    <p>Persona 5, ahhh yes the most popular game in the entire franchise. </p>
    <p>Yeah this game is good, I think in terms of style and flair it easily blows its predecessors out of the water. 
      The mix of red and blacks truly give off this feeling of rebellion and the theme of changing the future that are present 
      in the game from the opening minutes all the way to the final goodbye scene. </p>
    <p>I think in terms of gameplay it’s fun but it always felt like something was missing. I wish there were more stealth elements, 
      it felt like the stealth elements that were present didn’t require actually thinking about the best ways to clear a room without 
      being seen you could basically just brute force your way through without thinking about it. And yes I understand at its core this 
      game is an RPG, making an RPG where you could avoid all fights would create a balancing issue but gosh darn it my favorite portions 
      of the game were the palace infiltrations specifically BECAUSE it felt sneaky, I want more of that please and I’d honestly sacrifice the balance of the game if it meant I could do more of that.</p>
    <p>The story is good, Maruki is a compelling antagonist with a genuinely sad backstory and the best part is that he is a 
      villain that ACTUALLY can be sympathized with. The guy just really loved his wife and wanted the best for people. That being said,
      the way he went about “helping” people is morally questionable at best and a blatant human rights violation worst but that’s a 
      description suited for a much longer discussion.</p>

    <h2>Shin Megami Tensei 4</h2>
    <p>So here we cover a game in the actual main line series.</p>
    <p>SMT 4 is a very interesting romp through a modern Tokyo after an apocalyptic event flooded the city with demons. 
      A group of samurai then head off to find the source of the demons and, through the choices of the players, destroy the source 
      and restore law and order, embrace the source causing more chaos, or find a middle ground of both.</p>
    <p>This game was great, fast snappy combat, an interesting story, characters that actually grow and progress throughout the 
      journey and not to mention the music is pretty solid.</p>
    <p>I will say I see a lot of people complain about the smirk system in this game, a mechanic where if you hit an enemies weak 
      point or if an enemy hits your weak point there is a chance you/the enemy get an extra turn, and they say it is unbalanced but I 
      personally never had an issue with it and I thought it was a welcomed change to shake up the gameplay.</p>

    <h2>Shin Megami Tensei 3: Nocturne</h2>
    <p>This will be the last one I cover so I'll keep this one brief.</p>
    <p>SMT Nocturne is hard and I love it. It's super weird, the concepts presented are extremely interesing, and the demi-fiend 
      is an awesome name for an awesome character design.</p>
    <p>10/10 and if it wasn't for Persona 3 this would be the best SMT title on the Playstation 2.</p>
